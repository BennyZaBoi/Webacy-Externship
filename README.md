# Webacy-Externship
Web3 Security Data Analytics Externship

**Who is this with?:** Webacy and Extern  

**Objectives in this Externship:** Learning about smart contact vulnerabilities, how to prevent them, what causes them, and analyzing the frequency, correlation, and utilizing data analysis techniques to find common risk profiles.

## Structure of The Program:

### Week 1: Data Labeling
**Objective:** Finding out about the significance of data labeling. 
- **Activities:** 
  - Study up on smart contacts and Web3.
  - Determine and mark vulnerabilities in smart contracts with pre-established risk labels.

### Week 2: Data Validation
**Objective:** Boosting the dependability of the dataset.
- **Activities:** 
  - Verify the accuracy of the labels peers have assigned to the data.

### Week 3: Frequency and Correlation Analysis
**Objective:** Building frequency and correlation analysis proficiency.
- **Activities:**
  - Look at the frequency at which each hazard tag appears.
  - Find significant relationships between different risk classifications.


### Week 4: Cluster Analysis
**Objective:** Analyze data cluster from the risk profile.
- **Activities:** 
  - To identify shared risk profiles between smart contracts, use cluster analysis.
